### Centaur
Don't mind the name, I just came up with it randomly.

It would be a simple chatting app for the web for personal threads between people. The only way
to start chatting with somebody would be to share a unique link with them which would connect you
with them instantly!

Cool, right?

How to start a development state:
```
# clone the repo

cd Centaur
npm install
npm run dev

# on another cmd / terminal process

cd Source/Server/
node ExpressHandler.js
```

Here are some screenshots to get you started.
